This code is a JavaScript class-based application for tracking workout activities. It has classes for a generic workout, running, and cycling activities. It uses the navigator.geolocation API to get the user's location and display a map using the Leaflet library. When a user submits a form, a new workout instance is created and saved in an array of workouts. The user can view a list of their workouts and click on a workout to see its details.
